## Before using this calculator
1. Open a photo editor eg Pixlr, Photoshop
2. Get a Dynmap screenshot of your city

## Using this calculator
1. Run the Python script (main.py). Input the url of the image (note: if you're on repl.it, use ctrl+shift+v)
2. It will tell you whether you want measurements in blocks & km^2. Type y or n.
3. If you typed y, input the coordinates, eg. Northern Z coordinate will be what is the Z coordinate at the top of the image on the Dynmap
4. Wait for it to calculate.
